                    <h3>Old Kent Road</h3>
                    <p>£60</p>

                    <p>The Old Kent Road is a road in Southwark, South East London, England, and forms part of Watling Street, the Roman road which ran from Dover to Holyhead. The street is famous as the equal cheapest property on the London Monopoly board and is the only one in South London. It is mistakenly regarded as forming the boundary between Walworth, and Peckham to the south and Bermondsey to the north although the ancient parish and vestry boundaries of these as part of Camberwell do not in fact coincide with it, the Bermondsey boundary running along Rolls Road further north.</p>

                        <h3>Whitechapel Road</h3>
                        <p>£60</p>

                        <p>Whitechapel Road is a major arterial road in Whitechapel, Tower Hamlets, in the East End of London. It is named after a small chapel of ease dedicated to St Mary and connects Aldgate to the west (as Whitechapel High Street) with Mile End Road to the east. The road is part of the historic Roman Road from London to Colchester, now the A11.</p>
