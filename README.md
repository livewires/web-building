HTML & CSS overview for LiveWires

## Worksheets

Found in [sessions](sessions/).

1. Set up a basic HTML template
2. CSS to make the HTML look pretty
3. Make more pages
4. Optimise out CSS into other files

## Vagrant?

If you want to run this on your computer without having to set up Apache / PHP etc locally you can install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

Once installed in the terminal navigate to this folder (eg `cd ~/Projects/LiveWires/`) and enter `vagrant up`.

In your browser navigate to (http://127.0.0.1:8080).

## Long term plan...

The rough plan is to throw in [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) for templating.

And then run it off of a JSON file rather than a database.

If we get time then then t can be expanded to a full on CMS...

### Sessions

1. HTML layout
2. CSS for styles
3. Read content from JSON and send it through to Twig
4. Go build
5. Read/Write files
6. Files are rubbish, here is a database
7. Forms and other goodness
