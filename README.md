# ://LiveWires/HTML/CSS:lessons

HTML & CSS overview for LiveWires

## Worksheets

Found in [sessions](sessions/).

1. Set up a basic HTML template
2. CSS to make the HTML look pretty
3. Make more pages
4. Optimise out CSS into other files

## Long term plan...

The rough plan is to throw in [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) for templating.

And then run it off of a JSON file rather than a database.

If we get time then then t can be expanded to a full on CMS...

### Sessions

1. HTML layout
2. CSS for styles
3. Read content from JSON and send it through to Twig
4. Go build
5. Read/Write files
6. Files are rubbish, here is a database
7. Forms and other goodness
