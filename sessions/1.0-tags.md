# Building your first page...

Before writing any code you need to know what your website will be about. Have a think… you could pick anything you want!  Here are a couple of ideas:

- A hobby that you enjoy
- A game you're playing
- A TV show or film
- A sports team
- A band

## Getting going: A basic page with tags…

In these worksheets we're going to be teaching you how to _write_ websites, not using a drag and drop site creator or anything like that, instead you'll be writing the code from scratch.


Open up [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) (if you're using a LiveWires computer this will be installed already) or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com). Other editors are avalible... we just like these two!

Now in a new file create a file with this in it:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
    <title>Page title</title>
  </head>

  <body>

  </body>

</html>
```

Save this file as `index.html`. The `index.html` file is really important; it tells your computer that it is the homepage for your website. Any other pages you create can be called anything else.

Now open a web browser and open up your `index.html` file. You should have an empty page…

## Tags

`HTML` is a markup language. That's what the `ML` stands for in `HTML`. It provides structure to content… if you look at this page some of the text are headings… other bits of the text are paragraphs. `HTML` allows us to create that structure for a web browser to understand.

Content is surrounded by tags that tell the browser what type of content they are…

Here is an example of a paragraph tag:

```html
<p>
  This is a paragraph. Really!
</p>
```

A tag is made up of three parts:

1. An opening tag
2. The tag contents
3. A closing tag

Can you see the three parts in the paragraph tag? There is the opening tag: `<p>`, the closing tag: `</p>`, and the contents in the middle.

Any text that you want to appear on your page needs to be added to your `HTML` as the contents of the `<body>` tag.

Let's try adding a paragraph to our page now. Your `<body>` tag should now look like this:

```html
<body>
  <p>
    This is a paragraph. Really!
  </p>
</body>
```

As you can see tags like `<body>` can have other tags as their content.

Save your file, and go to your web browser, open your `index.html` file. Refresh the web page and you should see the your text appear on screen.

## A few more tags…

There are a couple of other tags that you can use… try adding them to your `<body>` tag:

1. `<h1>` is a big heading…
2. `<h2>` is a smaller heading. You can go all the way down to `<h6>`
3. `<hr />` is a self closing tag. It just creates a divider on your page.

## Challenge

For your first page write some text with headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc), paragraphs (`<p>`) and dividers (`<hr />`). Remember that all your tags need to appear inside your `<body>` tag like this:

```html
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to my site about trains</h1>
  <p>A train is a form of transport consisting of a series of connected vehicles that generally runs along a metal track to transport cargo or passengers.</p>
</body>
```
