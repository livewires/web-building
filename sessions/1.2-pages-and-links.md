# Creating new pages

We've a page using `html`, but a website is normally more than just one page.

If you are writing a site about a book or a TV show, you might want a page about the characters… if you a writing about a sports team perhaps a page about the players… if a game perhaps a page about the storyline in it…

Make a copy of the `index.html` page and give a name based on the title of the page. If you are making a site about a tv show you might want a page about the characters, so you would call it `characters.html`. Make sure your file name has no spaces in it - it'll make things simpler later on.

Change the page title in the `<header>`

Go back to your web browser open up your new file. You should have a new page, but it looks very similar to your home page. Open up your new file in the text editor and give it a new title, and you can start adding in new content.

As you add content to your page there other some other tags that might be helpful:

**Images:**
```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of your image" />
```

**Lists:**
```html
<ol>
	<li>One</li>
	<li>Two</li>
	<li>Three</li>
</ol>
```

**Bullet points:**
```html
<ul>
	<li>Point</li>
	<li>Another point</li>
	<li>Final point</li>
</ul>
```

## Linking between pages

Now we have two pages, with some great content, we need make a way to get between the two pages. This is done with links.

Links are `HTML` tags with attributes, they look like this:

```html
<a href="file-name.html">
  Text to display in the link
</a>
```

We’re going to create a menu on our pages below the banner to allow visitors to navigate between the two pages.

Open up `index.html` again and scroll down to the end of the `<header>` and the beginning on the `<main>` tag:

```html
…
  </header>

  <main>
…
```

Now in-between these two tags we’re going to create a new element called `<nav>` for navigation:

```html
</header>

<nav>
  <div class="container">
    <ul>
      <li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="characters.html">The Characters</a></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</nav>

<main>
```

Do you see that we added a list with a new tag in it? The `a` tag creates a link; the `href="…"` tells the browser which file to link to, and then the text after what the visitor to your site sees:

```html
<a href="new-page.html">Text that is displayed</a>
```

Make sure that the second link points to your new page. Save the file, refresh the browser. Click through the new links… what happens? The second link will take you through to your second page, but because you don’t the code on the second page you can’t get back.

Copy the `<nav>…</nav>` code and paste it in the same place in your second page. Save it, refresh the page and you have a list on both pages with your navigation.

## Challenge

Fill out at least three pages on your new site.

If you are making a site about a TV show you might want to have a homepage, a page about the main characters, and a page giving an introduction to the plot of the story.

Include paragraphs, headings, images and lists.

Make sure the three pages are linked together in the `<nav>` tag.
