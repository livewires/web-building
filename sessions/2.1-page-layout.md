# Page layout

Our pages still feel pretty basic– we've changed some of the colours and fonts, but there is a lot more that `CSS` can do. Let's experiment with the header that appears at the top of your page…

## Working on the header

Let's say that you want an image at the top of your site… First you would need to find one. There are a couple of good places to look for images:

- [Pexels](https://pexels.com)
- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com)

Using one of these website search and find an image that matches the theme of your website. Download the image and save it to your website folder with the name `banner.jpg`.

Head back to your `CSS` file. We're going to need to add a new selector:

```css
header {
  background-image: url('banner.jpg');
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: center center;
  background-size: cover;
}
```

Save `style.css` and refresh the page…

We've already seen `background-color`… But these new `properties` also affect the background of an element. They all take in different values too… Experiment with some of these:

**`background-repeat`**

- repeat
- repeat-x
- repeat-y
- no-repeat

**`background-position`**

- left top
- left center
- left bottom
- right top
- right center
- right bottom
- center top
- center center
- center bottom

**`background-size`**

- auto
- cover
- contain

This is a good start… but you might have noticed that the image is only as high as the text that is in the box… For some images this might work, for others this is less that ideal. There's a new property we can add to our header called `height`. Height does what it says it will - it sets the height of an element. Unless you tell it otherwise an element will be as large as the content that is in it, but you can make it larger. Have a look at this example:

```css
header {
  background-image: url('banner.jpg');
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: center center;
  background-size: cover;
  height: 400px;
}
```

We've added `height: 400px;`. When you are measuring something on paper you would use the units of centimeters (`cm`) or maybe millimeters (`mm`). With `CSS` one of the units of measurement we have is pixels (`px`). Add this in a refresh the page. Try changing this to different values. What works best for your image?

## Flexing the boxes…

At the moment you can't see it… but each element is a rectangle. Let's write some `CSS` to show the boxes on your page. Add to the `CSS` that controls your `header`:

```css
  border: 4px solid yellow;
```

Save and refresh the page. Around your header image you should now have a thick yellow border.

Now, let's add a new selector. What's the first element within our `header` tag in the `HTML`?

Write a selector which adds a `4px` border in a different colour for that element.

You'll now be able to see a smaller rectangle within your header that wraps tightly around the two headings.

`CSS` allows us to control where inside the `header` the `hgroup` element appears by changing the `header` `display` property… Update your `header` selector to match:

```CSS
header {
  background-image: url('banner.jpg');
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: center center;
  background-size: cover;
  height: 400px;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

Save your `CSS` and refresh your page; the `hgroup` should be in the middle of your `header`.

As with our `background` styles, `justify-content` and `align-items` have different values you can try:

**`justify-content`**

- left
- right
- center
- stretch
- space-around
- space-between

**`align-items`**

- start
- center
- end
- stretch


Experiment with the different values for `justify-content` and `align-items`. Can you get the `hgroup` to stick to the bottom left?

What happens when you add those properties to the `hgroup` selector?

## `Class` in `CSS`

So far we have been using `HTML` element names to hook our `CSS` onto. But that isn't the only way we select something with `CSS`. We can use a `class`, a class is an attribute you can add to a tag in `HTML`… it looks like this:

```html
<section class="container">
  Hello world!
</section>
```

You can see that we've extended the opening tag with `class="container"`. Go into your `index.html` file add add `class="container"` to both the `<section>` and `<footer>` tag. Now if you save that not a lot will happen… We need to tell the `CSS` about it.

If we were to add a selector in `CSS` like this: `container {}` it wouldn't work. The `CSS` would be trying to look for a tag in the `HTML` called `<container>` which doesn't exist. Instead we need to prefix the selector with a `.` to tell the `CSS` to select the classes:

```css
.container {
  border: 1px solid blue;
  color: orange;
}
```

Save your `html` and `css` and refresh your page. Now _both_ your `<section>` and `<footer>` have the blue border and orange text.

Classes are a good way of applying the same style to a lot of different tags.

Our `.container` class is looking a little bit ugly so lets replace it with some different styles:

```css
.container {
  margin: 0 auto 0 auto;
  max-width: 800px;
}
```

What these properties do is set the margin of each side of the element to be `0px` on the top and bottom, and automatically (`auto`) work out the left and right margin. Then it sets the maximum width (`max-width`) of the element to be `800px`. This effectively ensures that the element stays in the center of it's containing element.

Save it and see…

## Extra: Editing images…

You may need to edit an image for your site. That might making it smaller, cropping it, etc.

For example in the header example the image works best when it is 400 pixels (or `px`) high, and as wide as the screen. There are many different tools to crop images, if you have GIMP installed use that or have a look at [canva.com/photo-editor/](https://www.canva.com/photo-editor/). Open your image, and then in `image/image size` set the height of your image. Using the crop tool `image/crop` you can cut your image down to the right size. Finally save you image `File/save` back to your folder as `banner.jpg`.
