# Page layout

Our pages still feel pretty basic– we've changed some of the colours and fonts, but there is a lot more that `CSS` can do. Let's experiment with the header that appears at the top of your page…

## Working on the header

Let's say that you want an image at the top of your site… First you would need to find one. There are a couple of good places to look for images:

- [Pexels](https://pexels.com)
- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com)

Using one of these website search and find an image that matches the theme of your website. Download the image and save it to your website folder with the name `banner.jpg`.

Head back to your `CSS` file. We're going to need to add a new selector:

```css
header {
  background-image: url('banner.jpg');
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: center center;
  background-size: cover;
}
```

Save `style.css` and refresh the page…

We've already seen `background-color`… But these new `properties` also affect the background of an element. They all take in different values too… Experiment with some of these:

**`background-repeat`**

- repeat
- repeat-x
- repeat-y
- no-repeat

**`background-position`**

- left top
- left center
- left bottom
- right top
- right center
- right bottom
- center top
- center center
- center bottom

**`background-size`**

- auto
- cover
- contain

There are other things that we can do to our `header` element styles…

```css
header {
  background-image: url('banner.jpg');
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: center center;
  background-size: cover;
  color: white;
  height: 400px
}
```

Depending on the image that you have chosen and the text colour, it may be hard to read the title, so lets fix that. While we're at it we can make the text stick to the bottom of the header:

```css
hgroup{
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 0;
  margin: 0 auto;
  display: block;
  width: 100%;
  padding: 10px;
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7);
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

The first block of code sets the position of the `hgroup` tag to be at the `absolute bottom` of it's parent element (the `header`), and set it's background to be black. While the second block targets the `h1` and `h2` tags in the `header`, making sure that they have a width and they stay in the centre of the page.

## Tweaking the rest of the page

Add this into your `CSS`:

```css
section {
  background-color: #ccc;
  padding: 10px;
}

  section h2 {
    margin-bottom: 10px;
  }

  section p {
    margin: 20px 0;
  }

    section p:last-child{
      margin: 20px 0 0;
    }

footer {
  clear: both;
  padding: 10px;
}

  footer p {
    font-size: 12px;
    margin: 0;
  }
```

This will adjust the space all the elements. However now when you refresh your page you'll see that the `header` text sits nicely in the middle of the page, while the rest of the text is stuck to the left.

In the `CSS` add:

```css
.container {
  margin: 0 auto;
  max-width: 800px;
}
```

Now going back to the `HTML` below. In your `<section>` tag, but before your `<p>` tag add in `<div class="container">`, and then just before your closing `</section>` tag add in a closing `</div>` like this:

```html
<section>
  <div class="container">
    <p>Welcome...</p>
  </div>
</section>
```

Once you have done that, do the same in the footer and save and refresh the page.

## Extra: Editing images…

You may need to edit an image for your site. That might making it smaller, cropping it, etc.

For example in the header example the image works best when it is 400 pixels (or `px`) high, and as wide as the screen. There are many different tools to crop images, if you have GIMP installed use that or have a look at [canva.com/photo-editor/](https://www.canva.com/photo-editor/). Open your image, and then in `image/image size` set the height of your image. Using the crop tool `image/crop` you can cut your image down to the right size. Finally save you image `File/save` back to your folder as `banner.jpg`.
