# Page structure

As we said in the first sheet; `HTML` provides the structure for content on a page. A page will typically be made of three key sections:

- A `<header>` - a section repeated at the top of every page containing a logo and the site title.
- The `<main>` content on the page.
- A `<footer>` which might tell you about the author of the page and some important links.

Lets add them in to our `index.html` page now.

Straight after your opening `<body>` tag let's add a header…

```html
<header>
  <hgroup>
    <h1>Site name</h1>
  </hgroup>
</header>
```

Save your file and refresh the page in your browser.

You should now have a heading at the top of your page. Go and update the content with your page name.

The `<header>` tag creates a header for your page… but now we need to create a footer for your page. Before the closing `</body>` tag add this:

```html
<footer>
    <p>Made by [your-name] at LiveWires</p>
</footer>
```

## Adding sections

As you can see content on a page can be grouped… The `<header>` tag groups everything for your page header, and the `<footer>` groups everything in your page footer.

The main content of your page can be grouped with the tag `<main>`. 

After your closing `</header>` and before your opening `<footer>` tag wrap the rest of your page content with a `<main>` tag:

```html
  …
</header>

<main>
   <h1>Heading</h1>
   <p>This is a paragraph. Really!</p>
</main>

<footer>
  …
```

Save and refresh your page.

Not a huge amount will have changed… but this will come in handy later on.
